# Changes between vendor releases

The vendor provides [release_notes](release_notes), Sometimes additional information comes to light when comparing the cleaned-up branches - that's where these review notes may help.

To generate the diff, use something like this:
```
git diff -D cleanup/v0.3.6.15 cleanup/v0.3.6.16.1
```

## vendor-drop/v0.3.6.17.1
- Fix compilation error under RHEL 8

- AQR105 PHY firmware updated from XXX to 2.b.e2

## vendor-drop/v0.3.6.15
- The Marvell PHY control that was removed in 0.3.6.14.3 has reappeared (without the required firmware/initialisation data blobs!) and the 'Marvell' name has been replaced with 'Pele' for what could only be trademark lawyer nonsense.
